<h1>The Cheapo Website Template</h1>
<p>This is the demo deploy of the <a href="https://github.com/irskep/cheapo_website">Cheapo Website Template</a>.
It doesn't do much, but you can
<a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}">log in</a> or
<a href="{{ url_for('auth.register') }}">register</a> to test the user account feature.

<h2>PostgreSQL is a scam!!!</h2>

<p>Don't let Big Tech sell you an 18 wheeler when all you need is a bicycle.
Your side project doesn't need a $15/mo Postgres instance. Those 2,000 Medium articles
about how to deploy your bootcamp app with a Professional Database are trying to bleed you
dry now that Heroku hates freedom. Keep that storage free, comradeâ€”SQLite is the People's Database!</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ol>
<li>Deploys with just a little downtime, as a treat. Give servers the naps they deserve.</li>
<li>Potentially zero dollars to host unless you get popular in which case more like two dollars.</li>
<li>Maybe scalable? If not, it's probably your fault!</li>
<li>100% unproven but pretty likely to work OK.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technology???</h2>

<ol>
<li>SQLite <strong><em>in production</em></strong> ðŸ˜ˆ</li>
<li><a href="https://render.com">Render</a> ($7/mo) or <a href="https://fly.io">Fly.io</a> (basically free)</li>
<li>Python, <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">Flask</a>, and boilerplate for stuff everybody wants but Flask is too hipster to include by default (Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-Migrate)</li>
</ol>
